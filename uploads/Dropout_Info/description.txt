This query is used to identify potential dropouts among students pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Students who haven't taken exams in the last three terms or didn't pass any exams in their first term are considered at risk of dropping out. The query then groups students by their characteristics to determine their potential dropout status. After training a model, the model's prediction probability, referred to as the 'Risk Score', is assigned to each student. The students are then ranked based on their 'Risk Score', listing those with higher scores first, helping to prioritize and support students who may need extra attention.
