This query aims to identify students who may not achieve the required 100 credit points (CP) after completing four semesters of their Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. It assesses various aspects including the number of exams taken, exam performance, and the average grades during the first term. The model assigns a 'Risk Score', representing the likelihood of not meeting the credit requirement. Students are then ranked based on their 'Risk Score', with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of not accumulating the required credits.
