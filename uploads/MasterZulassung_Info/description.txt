This query is employed to predict whether students pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science will meet the eligibility criteria for admission to the Master's program, considering an average final grade of 2.5. It analyzes their exam results and computes the average grade. The model's prediction probability, termed the 'Risk Score', is assigned to each student. Students are then ordered based on their 'Risk Score', prioritizing those with higher scores. This helps identify students who are more likely to meet the requirement for admission to the Master's program.
